Basic Instructions:
Download zip file, the runnable program (.exe) can be found in the 'dist' folder.

The program is CASE SENSITIVE, elements should be written
exactly as they are shown on the periodic table. 

Subscripted numbers are put directly behind the element it belongs to, do not
include spaces.
Example:To calculate molar mass of glucose, type in 'C6H12O6'.
Water would be 'H2O'.

Parenthese works as long as you don't put a parenthesis winthin another.
Multiple parenthese are supported as long as they are not nested.
Put a number after the closing bracket to multiply everything in parentheses by
said number. 
Example: Na(NH3)3(SO4)2 would work but Na(NH3(SO4)) would not. 

Output is in g/mol.
================================================================================
Some extra notes:
The runnable program (.exe) can be found in the 'dist' folder.

The source code is included, feel free to customize whatever but 
remember the .exe will not update based on changes in the .py file. 

Vales are taken from the IB Chemistry Data Booklet (rounded to 2 decimal
digits) so output values may be slightly off by a bit if you are using
more decimally precise values. 

The program does not include elements with a molar mass 
that is contained within parentheses except for Francium (Fr)
and Technetium (Tc).
